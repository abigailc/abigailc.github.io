Well.
I made this website and then immediately forgot about it, as you do.

Here's a life update -- the first, so is it really even an update? 
maybe this is just Life: The Beginning (of the blog). Anyways.

This is my first semester in Grad School! 
I love it, so far. I'm getting paid to learn! My classes are, for maybe the first time ever, directly relevent to things I want to do!

I am pretty sure I could be doing it better, though. I've definitely been not-working more than I would like, mostly due to a lack of strict scheduling. And I feel that I ought to be meeting more professors and other students than I have been, but I am an awkward duck who doesn't like to feel like I am imposing on anyone's time. I say this publically, so maybe I will improve at those two things. Getting an office on campus and making weekly-meeting plans with professors I want to work with are steps in the right direction, and I am working on getting both of those set-up, as well as an actual project that I can focus my non-classwork time on.

In related news, braincases are complicated, fish are weird, and my utter lack of background in anatomy and developmental biology is a Problem. I am currently at the level where I try to read a paper, get sidetracked by tons of jargon (mostly anatomical in nature), and end up reading textbooks for a few hours to understand the context. I am pretty sure I am learning, but it's a bit rough right now not being able to just get through anything in a straightforward manner.
