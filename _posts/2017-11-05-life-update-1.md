Well.
I made this website and then immediately forgot about it, as you do.

To-Do:  make a banner, make the posts prettier, change the horrible color scheme.

This is my first semester in Grad School! 
I love it, so far. I'm getting paid to learn! My classes are, for maybe the first time ever, directly relevent to things I want to do!
Braincases are complicated, fish are weird, and my utter lack of background in anatomy and developmental biology is a Problem.
