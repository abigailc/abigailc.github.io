Hi Everyone!

My name is abby, and I am starting a blog! 

Why, you might ask?

Well, to be quite honest, I'm not entirely sure. I intend to post about animals, science, puzzles, projects, and my life here. Maybe even include some art or videos... we will see how ambitious the project gets. In general, I feel awkward sharing too much on facebook, but twitter/insta doesn't give me enough space to develop thoughts and ideas, so, well, here we go.

As a side-note, I know nothing about making websites, and am already /slightly/ regretting not just using wordpress. #YOLO

Who am I?

I am a grad student at UChicago in the Evolutionary Biology. I want to study the earliest fishes and sharks via paleontology, phylogenetic methods, ecology genetics development time travel etc etc etc. I'm a first year, don't expect details yet. The aim of the academic side of this blog is to maybe be able to track genesis of my own ideas over time, and to share fun Fish Facts with internet strangers. In the past I was at MIT: undergrad course 7 - mostly disease research and cell/microbio stuff, then two years as research tech in molecular phylogenetics/horizontal gene transfer. I got involved with the MIT Mystery Hunt there since I lived on Floorpi (EC 3W) and they had a small ~15 person floor team. I helped turn that into the current Galactic Trendsetters via the establishment of HuntComm at a very angsty budget meeting, for Floor Unity reasons (aka because I wanted to hunt with all my friends, and they wanted to be competitive). I want to be better at puzzles, and to understand what I like and dislike in puzzle hunts, so I guess I am going to blog about them? Haha we will see how that goes.

Wheee
